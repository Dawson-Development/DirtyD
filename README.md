Game Rules:
1) The first step… Shuffle the deck ding dong…
2) Each player starts by drawing 7 cards.
3) Designate a player to be the judge.
(You know that “special” someone)
4) The judge draws a purple card and lays it
down face up.
5) All other players answer the questions or
fill in the blanks by laying down a white card.
6) The judge then picks the best answer(s) that
match the card. That could be the most
accurate/ridiculous/or absurd card(s).
7) Whichever players cards were picked takes
the purple card (keep it). The white cards
are placed to the side or re-shuffled back into
the deck. That player also become the new
judge!
8) After each round all players should draw back
up to their original 7 cards.
